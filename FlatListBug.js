This error occurs when using the `FlatList` component in React Native and you try to render a large number of items without proper optimization.  The error message might not be specific, but you'll observe performance issues like lag, slow scrolling, or even crashes. This is because the default behavior of `FlatList` is to render every item at once, which can overwhelm the UI thread if the dataset is extensive.
